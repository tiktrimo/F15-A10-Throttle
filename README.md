## Before starting
Currently grip & button design is prototype. BOM and Design might be changed soon <br>


## How to assemble this thing?
Full Assembly will look like this
CAD : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9c9382d8df36aa0526aca5f2/w/d303e81adbf04704e1026cf4/e/e40f8d27cd1b9c80dca9e98c
I will not upload file in this repository. You can download part's stl file in above link. 
1. Right click the part
2. Select export 
3. Change parameter like below <br>
Format : STL <br>
STL Format : Binary <br>
Units : Milimeter <br>
Resolution : Fine <br>
Option : Download <br>

BoM & Notes:<br>
- Bearing 6901zz * 2
- M5x25 cross head/hex bolt * 24
- M5x35 cross head/hex bolt * 4
- M5 nut * 28
- M2x4 cross head/hex bolt * 2
<br>

Buttons & Rotary encoder
- PEC12R-4220F-N0024 * 1 : 24step ditent rotary encoder
- MTS-103 * 1 : 3step Toggle switch
- TH101010 * 2 (5 Way button)
<br>

Used WSH135-XPAN2 Hall effect sensor. This was cheapest in store and cost about 50 cent. With 4x4x10mm neodymium magnet it gives 500 steps on each axis.


## Recommendation
I recommend to change gap between buttons and head. Currently gap is 0.1 ~ 0.2mm. For my printer 0.15mm gap gives perfect fit.
